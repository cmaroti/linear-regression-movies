# linear-regression-movies

For project #2 at Metis we were supposed to scrape data from the internet and use it to predict something with a linear regression model. I decided to try to predict a movieâ€™s total foreign box office, as well as what genres are more popular in certain other countries relative to others.

I have posted my code for my `scrapy` script and my data analysis, and a PDF of my final slide presentation.

Check out my [blog post](https://cmaroti.github.io/project-luther/) for a more detailed description of my project and results.
